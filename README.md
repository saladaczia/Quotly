# Application Name: Quotly

**Quotly** is a simple iOS application written in Swift that delivers popular random quotes.  
The app was created primarily as a **portfolio project** to showcase skills in iOS development with **SwiftUI, SwiftData, Combine, and API integration**.  
It is intentionally kept simple, focusing on clean design, core functionality, and demonstrating technologies that weren’t used in my previous projects.

## Features

- 💬 Random inspirational quotes  
- ⭐ Save favorite quotes for quick access  
- 🎨 Minimalistic and beautiful design  
- 🔄 Refresh button for new quotes instantly  
- 💾 Local data storage with SwiftData  

## Technologies and Tools

- **SwiftUI** – building the user interface  
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** – app architecture  
- **Combine** – reactive bindings / data flow  
- **SwiftData** – persistence for favorites (new vs previous apps)  
- **REST API integration (URLSession)** – fetching quotes from a remote API (new vs previous apps)  

## What’s New vs Previous Projects

- ✅ **SwiftData** instead of simple `UserDefaults` for storing user data (favorites).  
- ✅ **Remote REST API** for quotes (previous projects used primarily local JSON).  

## How to Run the Application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saladaczia/Quotly.git
cd Quotly
```

1. Open the `Quotly.xcodeproj` file in Xcode  
2. Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device  

## Summary

**Quotly** is a minimalistic yet useful app that delivers bite-sized inspiration.  
It was designed as a **showcase project** for my portfolio, highlighting key iOS development skills such as SwiftUI, SwiftData, Combine, and API integration.
